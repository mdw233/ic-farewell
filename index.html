            <p>Thank you so much for your support and utilization of ImagineCareers.com over the years.  We are very grateful.</p>
            <p>As you can imagine (no pun intended), disrupting the job seeker market can be challenging, and despite our best efforts, 
                we have made the difficult decision to shut down the company and the product effective Jan 1, 2018.  
                If you have any questions or concerns, please email <a href="mailto:support@imaginecareers.com">support@imaginecareers.com</a> and we'd be happy to address them directly.</p>
            <p>The passion to connect people with opportunity remains in each member of the IC team, and while we are leaving the product development space at this time, 
                many of us are shifting our focus back to recruiting and consulting, and will be joining Progress City LLC, a consultancy focused on providing innovative solutions for 
                companies in the areas of talent, culture, and organizational development.  If you are a job seeker in need of help finding your next opportunity or a 
                company who may need our expert services at Progress City, please email <a href="mailto:info@progresscity.net ">info@progresscity.net </a>we'd be happy to hear from you.</p>
            <p>We wish you a blessed 2018.</p>
            <p>
                <div>Sincerely,</div>
